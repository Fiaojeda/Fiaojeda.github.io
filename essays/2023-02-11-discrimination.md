### A lookout of Faith Ringgold's exposition Black is Beautiful

##### February 11 2023

Society and individuals are built upon multiple principles, among them justice and equality. Freedom is also important, but one cannot say to be free if conditioned to arbitrary situations. The idea that individuals should have equal opportunities and access to resources is central to the concept of justice, and it is crucial to ensuring that individuals can live fulfilling and meaningful lives. However, it is important to recognize that freedom and justice are not always mutually reinforcing. In this essay I will explore the role that standardization plays in shaping society, configuration of justice, and the use of art as a promotion gender and racial equality. The creation of standards through norms can often lead to the marginalization of certain groups and individuals who are seen as deviating from the norm. Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of human dignity and human rights, not everyone is treated equally in practice. At this point, the legal system has an important role to play in promoting justice, but justice is not limited to the realm of the judiciary, as social, cultural, or local practices also shape the conception and practice of justice. Lastly, forms of activism and expression such as art, are fundamental tools in the pursuit of justice and equality.

## Standardization: normalization of inequality

Due to the configuration of power and intervention upon individual liberties in societies, institutions mandate “the rules of the game” and mass behavior. Consequently, what is normal/anormal, beautiful/ugly, good/bad is established. One of the outcomes of categorizing is the standardization of society: the creation of barriers and expectations to function according to the standards. Philosopher Michel Foucault mentions how the relations between the subject, the truth, history, and constitution of experience articulate society’s behavior.

When society standardizes certain norms or expectations, it creates a narrow definition of what is considered normal or ideal. This can result in exclusion and marginalization for individuals or groups such as those with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or individuals from minority cultural backgrounds. In his book, Madness and Civilization, Foucault examines that the confinement of "mad" individuals in asylums was not just about providing medical care, but also about controlling and disciplining those who were considered deviant or disruptive to society. In this way, Foucault saw the treatment of "madness" as an example of the broader mechanisms of power and control that operate in modern societies, and he argued that the norms and standards of society had a profound impact on the experiences of those considered "crazy" (Foucault, 1964).

Although international institutions recognize that “equality means equal concern and respect across difference. It does not presuppose the elimination or suppression of difference. Respect for human rights requires the affirmation of self, not the denial of self” (Clapham, pg. 4); society has already set up a scenario in which inequalities are reproduced. Therefore, the “embrace everyone and accept people for who they are” (Clapham, pg. 4) can only be employed partially. Foucault's analysis of the treatment of "crazy" individuals highlights the important connection between power, knowledge, and the norms and standards of society. Mad people fall under the category of a minority discriminated, but they are not the only minority in society.

## It doesn’t need to go to court to be called justice.

Human rights are a cornerstone of a just and equitable society, but their universalization and consistent implementation remains a challenge. Cultural and political practices play a significant role in shaping attitudes towards human rights and justice. Influence from political polarization, lack of accountability, police brutality and arbitrary decision making can lead to a failure to uphold human rights and protect certain populations. In the exposition, Black is beautiful of Faith Ringgold, there were several paintings alluding to violence and inequality towards black people in USA. Despite the recognition of their rights in laws and policies, there is often a gap between what is written and what is done.
Racism is deeply ingrained in the culture of the United States and has a long history dating back to the country's founding. Although progress has been made over the years, racism continues to be a pervasive issue. This is perpetuated in the persistent racial disparities in areas such as education or employment, there are also implicit biases and stereotypes, police brutality and an ongoing prevalence of hate groups and individuals who promote racist ideologies.

Color of Change, a group that promotes racial justice, published a report finding that television shows often portrayed police officers conducting illegal searches or racially profiling suspects, and often did not frame such actions as worthy of condemnation (Tracy, 2022). This reinforces a culture of impunity and intolerance rooting from the living room in every house. Equality and justice to integrate black individuals in society goes beyond a court decision. Familiar, social, and cultural practices also influence how justice is served. With that mentioned, justice does not always need to be resolved in a court to be considered just. Justice also refers to a sense of fairness and moral righteousness in society and in individuals' interactions with one another.

## Art: symbol of resilience

Art can play an important role in promoting equality and addressing social justice issues. Through the power of storytelling, art can raise awareness about inequality, challenge dominant narratives, and inspire people to take action. Art serves as a symbol of resilience for black communities by allowing them to reclaim their voice, to celebrate their culture, and to heal from the trauma of racism. It also helps to build community and create a sense of belonging, which is especially important in the face of systemic discrimination and marginalization. This can help to break down stereotypes and challenge dominant narratives, creating a more inclusive and diverse representation of society.

After the death of George Floyd in 2020 due to police brutality there has been a large movement around the globe to fight systematic racism. CeCe Carpio, public art advisor for the city of Oakland, expressed that “Many times, our public artworks serve as altars—a place where people gather to acknowledge what is going on, seek resolutions, and a place to gather and heal” (Adiele, 2022). Like this, art can raise awareness about social justice issues and inequalities, helping educate people and inspire them to act. As well, art has the power to evoke emotions and create empathy, allowing people to connect with others who may have different experiences and perspectives. This can help to build understanding and bridge differences, promoting equality and justice. <br>

In summary, institutions establish some standards and mass behaviors in which, unfortunately, some societies create grounds for discrimination and impunity. However, minorities have found new ways of expression to reclaim their voice. Art has the power to challenge dominant narratives and bring to light the experiences of marginalized groups, helping to promote a greater understanding of the challenges faced by these communities. By using art to promote justice and freedom, individuals can help to create a more inclusive and equitable society.
