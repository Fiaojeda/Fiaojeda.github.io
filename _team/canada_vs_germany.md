 <br> Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of State of Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. Although she does not make important decisions herself, she is consulted for approval when decisions are going to be made. In Germany, instead, the president is the head of state.

## Political compass of political parties in Canada and Germany

The number of political parties in a government can show how power is distributed: if it is either concentrated or dispersed. Is important to have in mind that the number of political parties does not say accurately how strong a democracy is. Also, this political compass shows the current parties in the Parliament.
