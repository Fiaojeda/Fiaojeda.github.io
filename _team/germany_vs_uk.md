Because parties negotiate with each other, the support is visible, therefore, change is possible.                                                                       |                                                                                                   Ministry is subject to parliamentary confidence.

## Political compass of political parties in Germany and UK

The number of political parties in a government can show how power is distributed: if it is either concentrated or dispersed. Is important to have in mind that the number of political parties does not say accurately how strong a democracy is. Also, this political compass shows the current parties in the Congress/Parliament.
