Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II is head of State of Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. Although she does not make important decisions herself, she is consulted for approval when decisions are going to be made. In the US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ the president has the role of both head of government and head of state.

## Political compass of political parties in Canada and the United States

The number of political parties in a government can show how power is distributed: if it is either concentrated or dispersed. Is important to have in mind that the number of political parties does not say accurately how strong a democracy is. Also, this political compass shows the current parties in the Congress/Parliament. 

Since the US only counts with two parties: Democrats and Republicans, a political compass cannot be too useful. Instead, there is a visualisation of their ideologies. Democrats can be seen as the liberals and the Republicans can be seen as the conservatives.
