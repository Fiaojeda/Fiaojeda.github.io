A government system is the whole set of rules and institutions that shape the legal and political units over a territory (usually a country) and the population within. 

## Presidentialism: 
A presidentialist system consists of a president (executive), a judicial branch and a legislative branch. The president is the head of government and is essentially popularly elected to a fixed term. There is executive/legislative deadlock, meaning that there are restrictions as there are divisions of power. Therefore, a greater likelihood exists that the head of government will have limited administrative and party experience. <br>

## Parliamentarism: 
The ministry is the head of government, is selected by the legislature and subsequently depends upon the ongoing confidence of the legislature for remaining in office; thus, the period of mandate is alterable. <br>

The legislative branch of the parliamentary system versus the presidential system may either be unicameral or bicameral. <br>

## Federalism:
In a genuine democratic federation there is a compound sovereign state
A federation implies a condified and written constitution, normally acompained at the federal level by the supreme court. 
Federations can be multi-national/multi-ethnic or mononational.

**Multi-national/ multi-ethnic** <br>
The boundaries of the internal units are usually drawn that minorities control at least some of them. 
Switzerland was the first federation established in 1948 and Canada, established in 1848.

**Mononational** <br>
The intention behind national federalism is nation building and the elimination of internal national (and perhaps ethnic) differences. 
The United States is the founding nation of the mononational federalism. 


## Constitutional Monarchy: 
A democratic monarchy where the monarch exercises power although is under the rule of law. The legislature holds power apart from the monarch and there are constitutional rights. 
Federal republic
