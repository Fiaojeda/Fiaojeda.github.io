## Political divisions of Germany and the United States

## Chancellor of Germany and President(executive) of the United States

<br> Olaf Scholz ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and Joe Biden ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

The Chancellor of Germany (can also be seen as a Prime Minister) has the role of head of government. In the US, the president is the head of government.

## Chief/Head of state of Germany and the United States

<br> Walter Stermeier ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and Joe Biden ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ <br>
The president is the head of state of Germany. However, in the US the president has the role of both head of government and head of state. 

## Political compass of political parties in Germany and the United States

The number of political parties in a government can show how power is distributed: if it is either concentrated or dispersed. Is important to have in mind that the number of political parties does not say accurately how strong a democracy is. Also, this political compass shows the current parties in the Congress/Parliament. 

Since the US only counts with two parties: Democrats and Republicans, a political compass cannot be too useful. Instead, there is a visualisation of their ideologies. Democrats can be seen as the liberals and the Republicans can be seen as the conservatives.
