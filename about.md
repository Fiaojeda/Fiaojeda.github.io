I was born in Bogotá, Colombia. For my 14th birthday I moved to Bariloche, Argentina. In the patagonia, I studied my junior high years. It was a very nourishing experience. I could embrace and develop multiple language skills. After enjoying the local culture and making some friends, I continued my journey in Canada, close to the canadian rocky mountains, where I finished high school. Currently, I am enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts of Political Science at Del Rosario University, located in my hometown, Bogotá D.C.

When traveling across the continent I came across new cultures, which contributed to widen the perception of the world: how society is shapen from individuals. These experiences awakened an intense enthusiasm to study in more detail how social relationships articulate and shape the world we live in.

I enjoy reading (philosophy mainly) and analyzing political/government systems. Given my current education, I am constantly immersed in decision making processes, among nations and people. Among the topics that I enjoy to study and investigate are: how the modern era has shaped the mentality of the present, how the liberalism has been the most successful project until now, and how cultural codes influence the perception and decision making of people and nations.

Having in mind the geo-political conflict between Russia and Ucraine, I created a ["Geolocalizador de atentados"](https://github.com/Fiaojeda/geolocalizador) (Russian attack locator) in GitHub to visualize the attacks of Russia to Ucraine since the very first, which occured in February 24.

I am also an out of sight musician. In my free time I like to play the saxophone and the guitar. Mainly the saxophone. When I moved to Argentina, once I was told that “a good Argentinian knows how to play at least one instrument”. Although I am not argentinian, I embraced this and other cultural practices such as cooking to feed the soul; learning new instruments to share art, and kindness as a personal trait. Due to the pluriculturalism Canada holds, I also learned the different shapes kindess can take: language, ethnicity, culture and religion.
