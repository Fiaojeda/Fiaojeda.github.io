I was born in the city of Bogotá, Colombia, where I spent my early years. As I approached my 14th birthday, my life took a fascinating turn when I relocated to Bariloche, Argentina. In the heart of Patagonia, in this region I studied my junior high school years, a period marked by enriching experiences and personal growth. Immersed in the local culture, I not only expanded my understanding of the world but also enriched my artistic abilities, embracing the beauty of diversity and art.

The next chapter of my journey unfolded in Canada, in close proximity to the majestic Canadian Rocky Mountains. There, I completed my high school education, surrounded by the inspiring beauty of nature and multiculturalism that so highlights canadian society. The exposure to a different culture and environment broadened my perspective and fueled my passion for social settings in a globalized world. I also strenghtened my language skills, as I learned english and french.

Currently, I find myself back in my hometown, Bogotá D.C., where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science at Del Rosario University. This academic pursuit aligns with my curiosity about global affairs, political dynamics, development, as well as my commitment to contribute to society by bridging the gaps of inequalities.

In a recent chapter of my academic journey, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in an exchange program at Sciences Po Paris, further expanding my cultural horizons and fostering a deeper understanding of international relations, human rights and history.

Each chapter of my life has contributed to the diverse experiences that shape who I am today: a global citizen with rich cultural influences and a passion for unraveling the complexities of the political landscape. I shared my experiences in the tab of ["Diplomacy"](https://fiaojeda.github.io/diplomacy/), but is a work in progress. Moreover and having in mind the ongoing geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, my commitment to understanding and shedding light on significant global events took a tangible form. I developed the ["Geolocalizador de atentados"](https://github.com/Fiaojeda/geolocalizador), a Russian attack locator hosted on GitHub. This interactive tool provides a visual narrative of the attacks initiated by Russia against Ukraine since the inception of the conflict on February 24.

I enjoy reading and analyzing political/government's courses of action. Given my current education, I am constantly immersed in decision making processes, among nations and people. Along the topics that I enjoy to study and investigate are: how the modern era is constantly shaping the mentality of the present, how (neo)liberalism has been the most successful project until now, how do nations develop in the current digitalized era, and how cultural codes influence the perception and decision making of people and nations.

I am also an out of sight musician. In my free time I like to play the saxophone and the guitar. Mainly the saxophone. The seed that Argentina left in me. I embraced this and other cultural practices such as cooking to feed the soul; learning new instruments to share art, and kindness as a personal trait.In the multicultural universe that Canada is, I've cultivated a profound understanding of the diverse manifestations of kindness and to see the world from a humanitarian perspective. It transcends linguistic nuances, ethnic identities, cultural expressions, and religious affiliations.
