I was born in the vibrant city of Bogotá, Colombia, where I spent my early years. As I approached my 14th birthday, my life took a fascinating turn when I relocated to the breathtaking landscapes of Bariloche, Argentina. Nestled in the heart of Patagonia, this picturesque region became the backdrop for my junior high school years—a period marked by enriching experiences and personal growth.

Immersed in the local culture, I not only expanded my understanding of the world but also honed my linguistic abilities, embracing the beauty of diversity. Making lasting connections with friends added a warm, social dimension to my time in Argentina.

The next chapter of my journey unfolded against the backdrop of Canada, in close proximity to the majestic Canadian Rocky Mountains. There, I completed my high school education, surrounded by the awe-inspiring beauty of nature. The exposure to a different culture and environment broadened my perspective and fueled my passion for exploration.

In the multicultural tapestry that is Canada, I've cultivated a profound understanding of the diverse manifestations of kindness. It transcends linguistic nuances, ethnic identities, cultural expressions, and religious affiliations. This comprehensive appreciation stems from a conscious effort to explore the myriad ways in which kindness manifests within the rich fabric of pluralism that Canada embodies.

Presently, I find myself back in my hometown, Bogotá D.C., where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science at Del Rosario University. This academic pursuit aligns seamlessly with my curiosity about global affairs and political dynamics. In a recent chapter of my academic journey, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in an exchange program at Sciences Po Paris, further expanding my cultural horizons and fostering a deeper understanding of international relations, human rights and history.

Each chapter of my life has contributed to the diverse tapestry of experiences that shape who I am today—a global citizen with a rich tapestry of cultural influences and a passion for unraveling the complexities of the political landscape. I shared my experiences in the tab of ["Diplomacy"](https://fiaojeda.github.io/Diplomacy/)

I enjoy reading (philosophy mainly) and analyzing political/government systems. Given my current education, I am constantly immersed in decision making processes, among nations and people. Along the topics that I enjoy to study and investigate are: how the modern era has shaped the mentality of the present, how liberalism has been the most successful project until now, and how cultural codes influence the perception and decision making of people and nations.

Against the backdrop of the ongoing geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, my commitment to understanding and shedding light on significant global events took a tangible form. I conceived and developed the ["Geolocalizador de atentados"](https://github.com/Fiaojeda/geolocalizador), a Russian attack locator hosted on GitHub. This interactive tool provides a visual narrative of the attacks initiated by Russia against Ukraine since the inception of the conflict on February 24.

Beyond the academic and geopolitical realms, I lead a dual life as an unassuming musician. Channeling my creative energies, I indulge in playing the saxophone and the guitar, with a particular affinity for the former. This musical pursuit intertwines with other cultural practices, such as culinary artistry, as a means of nourishing the soul. My eagerness to learn new instruments becomes a vessel for sharing art, while kindness emerges as an intrinsic personal trait.
