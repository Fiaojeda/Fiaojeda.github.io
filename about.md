Sofía was born in Bogotá, Colombia. For her 14th birthday she had the opportunity to live in Bariloche, Argentina. After a couple of years, Sofia moved up to the canadian rocky mountains and finished her high school in Calgary, Alberta. Presently, she is enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts of Political Science at Del Rosario University, located in her hometown, Bogotá.

When traveling across the continent Sofia came across new cultures, habits and traditions that helped widen her cognition on how, from the individuals, the world is moulded. These encounters awakened an intense enthusiasm in her to study more profoundly how social relationships articulate the world we live in. 

Sofia enjoys to read, philosophy mainly. Due to her current Bachelor, she is constantly immersed in the world of how decision making is done (among nations and people), how the modern era has shaped the mentality of the present, and how the liberalism has been the most succesful project until now.

Having in mind the geo-political conflict between Russia and Ucraine, Sofia created a ["Geolocalizador de atentados"](https://github.com/Fiaojeda/geolocalizador) (Russian attack locator) in GitHub to visualize the attacks of Russia to Ucraine since the very first, which occured in February 24. 


Sofia is also an out of sight musician. In her free time she likes to play the saxophone or the guitar. When she moved to Argentina, once she was told that "a good argentinian knows how to play at least one instrument". Since she already knew the saxophone, Sofia was encouraged to learn to play the guitar. Ever since, Sofia and the music are one.
