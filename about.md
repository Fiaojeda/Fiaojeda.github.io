Sofía was born in Bogotá, Colombia. For her 14th birthday she had the opportunity to live in Bariloche, Argentina. After a couple of years, Sofia moved up to the canadian rocky mountains and finished high school in Calgary, Alberta. Presently, she is enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts of Political Science at Del Rosario University, located in her hometown, Bogotá.

When traveling across the continent Sofia came across new cultures, which contributed to widen her perception of the world: how society is shapen from individuals. These experiences awakened an intense enthusiasm to study in more detail how social relationships articulate and shape the world we live in.

Sofia enjoys reading (philosophy mainly) and analyzing political/government systems. Given her current education, she is constantly immersed in decision making processes, among nations and people. Among the topics that she enjoys to study and investigate are: how the modern era has shaped the mentality of the present, and how the liberalism has been the most successful project until now.

Having in mind the geo-political conflict between Russia and Ucraine, Sofia created a ["Geolocalizador de atentados"](https://github.com/Fiaojeda/geolocalizador) (Russian attack locator) in GitHub to visualize the attacks of Russia to Ucraine since the very first, which occured in February 24. 


Sofia is also an out of sight musician. In her free time she likes to play the saxophone and the guitar. When she moved to Argentina, once she was told that “a good Argentinian knows how to play at least one instrument”. Since she already played  saxophone, Sofia was encouraged to play the guitar. Ever since, Sofia and music are one.
