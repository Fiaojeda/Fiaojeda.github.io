Head of government, head of state, party system, legal system and other terms that are needed to understand the comparison of different countries and their political systems"

## Democracy: 
Democracy is a political regime. It presupposes the willingness of political actors to accept electoral and policy defeats. This willingness is enhanced when actors believe that defeats are reversible through the democratic struggle and that they are not catastrophic. Actors therefore need to establish a set of mutual guarantees that they will not destroy each other. Mainwaring 220.
