Remarkable experiences overseas. 

Because stories can be shared with pictures.

## Argentina

When first landed in Argentina, I fell in love with the culture: the elegant architecture, the modest fashion,the homemade gastronomy, and the people. Argentinians are the top of hilarious people I have met. 

The strong feeling of support and love for the nation among argentinians was curious to notice. It is very unlikely to encounter a national who does not believe Argentina is a great nation. If you say it is not, then I am to inform you are in trouble.
