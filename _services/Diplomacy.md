As part of my career I had numerous opportunities to meet important personalities around the world. Here I share the nurturing conversations and highlights of these meetings.

<br>

### Bogotá's councilor Juan Felipe Grillo

During 2022 I had the opportunity to work at the City Council of Bogota for the political party Cambio Radical.

### Embassador of Canada in France Stéphane Dion

During my exchange in Sciences Po Paris I had the pleasure to get to know Stéphane Dion. In this meeting several topics came up, like Canada's distinguished multiculturalism, what can the states do to stop the war in Ukraine and how to tackle climate change. The last had an emphasis in the north western passage, mainlt what is canada's strategy with the NW passage having in mind the climate crisis and the melting poles.
