Given the current situation in the United Kingdom and Scotland, **what is the best Scotland can do?**


The best option for Scotland‚Äôs Government is to pass a bill that calls for an independence referendum, with all the guarantees, and where all parties commit to respecting the result. All the guarantees means that the bill must have the approval of the British Parliament. 


### Why should the new referendum be held?

On several occasions Scotland has shown interest in passing a referendum to call out independence. Although it hasn‚Äôt had any success, the independence movement has slowly won popularity among the public and private sectors since 2016. People have expressed that, since Brexit, Britain has motivated the Scottish to pull forward the referendum for independence. Not only because Scotland had agreed certain terms and conditions with London about Brexit, but also because on many occasions Westminster dismissed and disregarded Scottish initiatives and opinions. As well, there are complaints about the centralism the British parliament holds. This has led the Scottish to reject the management of power and decision making from the British. 

In the DW documentary and The Telegraph, it can also be seen how different the Scottish feel from the British, they do agree to share the geographic location, but historically both nations have differed from each other. ‚ÄúThe diversity that brings together a nation‚Äù speech is no longer convincing for the Scottish. Neither does the (weak) intention to ‚Äúdemonstrate‚Äù the UK is a federal state. Scotland's autonomy can be seen as an example of a potential multinational federalist state. McGearry and O'Leary express that it is through the success of nationalism that federalism can be built, and it was accomplished once in the United Kingdom(2004). However, people‚Äôs testimonies and practices nowadays reflect that the union of the state is rather poor, and there is no space to think about a federal government. 


### Scotland could pass the bill at the local level, would that be enough for independence?

Nevertheless, the referendum needs to follow some requirements before. On this topic, Scotland needs the approval of the English Parliament. It is true that Sturgeon could pass a referendum bill at the local level without consulting London, but the legal panorama would be obscured. An unilateral call of independence would not be favourable for Scottish interests: they would be risking to be like Catalonia. The Autonomous Region of Spain in 2017 made an independence referendum without the approval of the central Government. Although the results were 92% / 8% in favour of independence, the referendum was not enough to make Catalonia a free country. Actually, Catalonian leaders ended up being persecuted by Spanish law. Due to the European Union not willing to  accept a country with an undefined legal status, an uncertain legal situation would be a major inconvenience if Scotland wants to join the European Union. 


### What about after?

Scotland must be aware of the challenge it brings to be independent, not should only think about what if that happens. After Brexit, joining the EU became one of Scotland‚Äôs main arguments to be independent from the UK. Yet, it is easier said than done. Some countries of the EU would reject the fact that, after an independence, Scotland would easily be a part of them. This can be taken as an incentive for secessionist movements. As a consequence, there could arise tensions and instability within European countries. 


### Then, when can it be done?

Although the covid crisis kind of shut down the process, Sturgeon‚Äôs pressure to call out a referendum is not gone. Boris Johnson expressed in a letter ‚ÄúYou and your predecessor made a personal promise that the 2014 Independence Referendum was a ‚Äòonce in a generation‚Äô vote‚Äù (Johnson, 2020); responding to Sturgeon‚Äôs demand for a new referendum. Nonetheless, since Sturgeon herself agrees that ‚ÄúScotland‚Äôs future should be in Scotland‚Äôs hands‚Äù (Channel 4 News, 2019), it is not after the legal panorama is clear and the negotiations with the British Parliament are done with all the guarantees that the referendum can be called.
